      <h2 class="banner">The Benefits of the Programming Industry</h2>
      <h2> For the longest time, I wondered why I should be in the programming industry. I eventually realized the many benefits of the programming industry. This sudden realization had given me a chance to try programming, and now it is one of my favorite things to do. I am here to spread this information to you.</h2>
      <h2>There is a large variety of jobs in the programming industry and these jobs are constantly evolving due to new changes in technology. A computer programmer is a job almost everybody has heard of. Their job is straightforward. “Computer programmers write and edit code for computer software programs and ensure the programs run with no errors,” (“6 Types of Programming Jobs”). Another popular job that is well known is a web developer. The general tasks of a web developer are also simple. “Web developers design and create websites. They are responsible for both how the site looks and how it functions,” (“6 Types of Programming Jobs”). A lesser known but also preferred job is known as a programming analysist. “Programming analysis is a compelling career because a career combines the jobs of a system analysist and a computer programmer,” (“6 Types of Programming Jobs”). Something good to know about program analysis is that “Employers hire programmer analysists to create specific programs that fit the individual needs of the organization or company,” (“6 Types of Programming Jobs”). Program analysis might just not be for you, but do not fear, for you could also chose to take on the tasks of being a computer systems engineer. Normally, “Computer systems engineers work to make sure their client’s computer systems are all fully functional and efficient,” (“6 Types of Programming Jobs”). It should also be known that “Computer systems engineers also innovate ideas to improve the functionality of their employer’s systems.” (“6 Types of Programming Jobs”). Maybe that job is still not for you, and maybe you still want to program things, but for a broader audience. Maybe you might want to be a software developer. “Software developers design and create software programs for a variety of computer systems,” (“6 Types of Programming Jobs”). Being a software developer is also great if you like to learn, because “The field is rapidly evolving as technology advances, so software developers are constantly learning and adapting,” (“6 Types of Programming Jobs”). But there is one more job you could be interested in: mobile app development. Statistically, “Mobile app development is one of the fastest-growing careers in the world. Mobile app developers design and code software for mobile devices like cell phones and tablets,” (“6 Types of Programming Jobs”). Mobile app development possibly could be your job or hobby.</h2>
      <h2>Before I tell you the benefits of jobs in the programming industry, I should define what programming is: “Programming is using a language that a machine can understand in order to get it to perform various tasks,” (“Why is Programming Important?”). Programming is beneficial to everyone in some way, whether they know it or not. For example, hospital equipment works with programming, your microwave was programmed to function how it does, and the biggest things, mobile devices, and computers. It should also be known what a program is, so here is a definition of what a program is: “A program is a group of logical, mathematical, and sequential functions grouped together,” (“Why is Programming Important?”). The importance of different programming languages is also important. “Each programming language focuses on different types of tasks as well as gives commands to the machine in different ways,” (“Why is Programming Important). The focus generally varies depending on what you want to do with a program, whether it’s a game, a work-related application used to make your job more productive, or simply a small application suiting your needs in specific. “Commands are the methods to control certain aspects of the program or machine,” (“Why is Programming Important?”). Commands will tell a program what you want it to do. Whether this command shows “Hello World” on your screen or closes the program, they all are important and useful. The benefits of the jobs in the programming industry are wonderful because it can keep you motivated and continue to love the career path. “Programming, most notably, can help refine your critical thinking and problem solving abilities,” (Alonsagay). Which, in short, means that programming generally makes your response to problems faster, because these increased problem-solving abilities help you think of a solution in a timely manner. “Programming sharpens your problem-solving skills. You take in the description of a larger problem and break it down into smaller pieces,” (Palic). Another thing is that “If you’re a worker who values flexibility, the right programming career may just suit your lifestyle needs,” (Alonsagay). These types of jobs are extremely beneficial to someone who may have to care for children, pets, or anything alike. It is convenient because “Computer programming is a career that can be performed from anywhere you can carry a laptop computer and that gives you access to the Internet,” (Martin). This is great when people work during a coffee break, or working while they are at the park, or anywhere else within reason. “Since computers are connected by networks, and now even most things live in the cloud, you don’t have to be tied to a specific location,” (Palic). This is one of the more convenient things, considering that things can now be stored in the cloud easily, you can save projects there, meaning projects you are working on do not need to take up a ton of space on your computer. Another benefit is that “Continuous advancements in the tech industry will only drive a greater need for programmers, developers, software engineers – and anyone else with a coding expertise,” (Alonsagay). The constantly growing market makes this the perfect time to start programming. The popularity helps because “Computer technology advances at a fast rate, keeping the demand for computer programmers at a high level,” (Martin). Also, “New languages and development environments are always coming out that can make your experience better and more efficient,” (Palic). Newer programming languages are convenient because they make projects run faster, smoother, or make them use less resources. Something else is that “On top of the abundant job market opportunities, those seeking a career in programming can easily find their start through the myriad of courses and training programs available,” (Alonsagay). The number of ways to learn programming languages is baffling, but beneficial for someone who might want to learn programming with a lower budget. Training is also relatively fast, considering that “Some computer programming training programs can be completed in just six months,” (Martin).  Programming can also be applied to other careers, “Though a programming skillset seems tailored for highly-specialized coding careers, they’re often applicable to other aspects in business and most other roles in the modern workforce,” (Alonsagay). This makes programming very useful in almost any case. “If you’re already working in the technical field, you can add to your current skills by learning to program,” (Palic). Programming generally can be applied in many ways, maybe with the use of problem-solving, or it could be for another programming language, either way, it is still helpful and applicable. “In our increasingly digital world, programming skills are only bound to grow in demand,” (Alonsagay). Technology has brought so much use to us and it is a very beneficial career path that you may enjoy.  Another thing is payment. Programmers receive a large amount of compensation for their work. “According to the Indeed website, starting salaries in the computer programming field in January 2012 range from $59,000 to 112,000 per year,” (Martin). This is a huge amount of money and can support a couple people. Considering that payment is important and that “Experienced programmers are hard to come by and command good salaries because of the level of training and education needed,” (Palic). Meaning, if you have more programming knowledge, you are more likely to get a higher paying job. “Technology production is an essential part of an evolving world. This means that computer programming is exceptionally important for our future as a global society,” (“Why is Programming Important”). Creativity is also huge in the programming industry, because “There are no limits to the things that you can create when you have the ability to write computer software,” (Palic). Creativity-inspired programs tend to get finished faster, made better, and cared about more often.</h2>
      <h2>These reasons show why programming is very important and what different jobs in the programming career do as their job. These jobs work closely together and keep each other functioning well. The benefits of the programming career could entice you or someone you know into joining the constantly advancing programming industry.</h2>
