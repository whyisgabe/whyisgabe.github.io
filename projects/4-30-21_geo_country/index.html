    <h2 class="projectitem"><b>The Mayans</b><br/>The Mayans created many technological advancements for their time. They made big advancements in the medical field with band aids made of hair, prosthesis, and pain killers. These innovative people lived on the Yucatan Peninsula and was divided into city-states that had a ruler for each one. These city-states had huge towers and temples, all built by the Maya. They were polytheistic, meaning they believed in multiple gods, and often mad human sacrifices, which was an honor in their culture. The Maya had many more advancements for the time in Mesoamerica, including a writing system of hieroglyphics, a set of numerals, and 3 different calendar systems, including our modern day one - Haab (365 days), Long Count (2,880,000 days, ended in 2012), and the Gregorian Calendar (Modern-Day Calendar). In larger and more important cities, there often were many sweat baths and saunas to cleanse themselves of impurities. You would also find a court for an ancient version of basketball called "Ulanna", which was played by getting a hard ball, or human head, through an impossibly small hole.<br/>The Mayans disappeared around 900AD and it is unknow what happened to them, but it has been theorized that there was a drought or that they started starving, and migrated to somewhere else where they could have a more reliable source of food.</h2>

    <h2 class="projectitem"><b>The Aztecs</b><br/>The Aztecs were told by their gods to find an eagle with a snake in its mouth on a cactus, and when they did, they placed their capital, Tenochtitlan, on the island, which resided in the Valley of Mexico, which is now Central Mexico. Their city had entrances on the North, South, and West sides. The design of the city included the interlacing of canals. The leader of the Aztecâ€™s job was to lead the people into war, which is how they thrived. The people were polytheistic, and their main god was named Huitzilopochtli. Human sacrifice was very common, as it was considered an honor. They sacrificed so many people, that during the reconciliation of the great pyramid in 1487, 84,400 people were sacrificed in the course of four days. The Aztecs also had many contributions to society including garbage men, whom made their cities extremely clean, mandated education, a hieroglyphic alphabet, Ullamaliztli, which was similar to Ulanna, and chocolate.<br/>The Aztecs finally disappeared after a gruesome battle against disease and Hernando Cortes in 1521.</h2>

    <h2 class="projectitem"><b>Cultural Details (Religion, Ethnicity, Language, and Customs)</b><br/>In Mexico, their culture is mainly based on their history, language, and families. Their official language is Spanish, but there are some indigneous Mayan languages remaining among small Mayan communities. Their religion is predominantly Catholic.</h2>
